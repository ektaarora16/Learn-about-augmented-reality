# What is Augmented  reality ?
A technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view.

Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli delivered via technology

# Key Takeaways

* Augmented reality (AR) involves overlaying visual, auditory, or other sensory information onto the world in order to enhance one's experience.

* Retailers and other companies can use augmented reality to promote products or services, launch novel marketing campaigns, and collect unique user data.

* Unlike virtual reality, which creates its own cyber environment, augmented reality adds to the existing world as it is.

# Understanding Augmented reality : 

Augmented reality is not a technology.aAugmented reality is a medium. Likewise, a book on augmented reality that only addresses the technology that is required to support the medium of augmented reality

It is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual

# Augmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality

The distinctions between VR and AR come down to the devices they require and the experience itself:

* AR uses a real-world setting while VR is completely virtual

* AR users can control their presence in the real world; VR users are controlled by the system

* VR requires a headset device, but AR can be accessed with a smartphone

* AR enhances both the virtual and real world while VR only enhances a fictional reality

# Technology

## Hardware : 

Hardware components for augmented reality are: a processor, display, sensors and input devices

## Display : 

Various technologies are used in augmented reality rendering, including optical projection systems, monitors, handheld devices, and display systems, which are worn on the human body.

## Eyeglasses : 

AR displays can be rendered on devices resembling eyeglasses. Versions include eyewear that employs cameras to intercept the real world view and re-display its augmented view through the eyepieces and devices in which the AR imagery is projected through or reflected off the surfaces of the eyewear lens pieces

# Augmented reality in today's world

Augmented reality is often presented as a kind of futuristic technology, but a form of it has been around for years. For example, the heads-up displays in many fighter aircraft as far back as the 1990s would show information about the attitude, direction and speed of the plane, and only a few years later they could show which objects in the field of view were targets. 

# The future of augmented reality :

This doesn't mean that phones and tablets will be the only venue for AR. Research continues apace on including AR functionality in contact lenses, and other wearable devices. The ultimate goal of augmented reality is to create a convenient and natural immersion, so there's a sense that phones and tablets will get replaced, though it isn't clear what those replacements will be. Even glasses might take on a new form, as "smart glasses" are developed for blind people. 

Like any new technology, AR has a lot of political and ethical issues. Google Glass, for example, raised privacy concerns. Some worried that conversations might be surreptitiously recorded or pictures snapped, or thought that they might be identified by face recognition software. AR glasses, contacts and more, like the Glass - X and Google Lens, though, are moving ahead in production and sales.
